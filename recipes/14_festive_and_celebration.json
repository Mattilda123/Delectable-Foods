          "plain flour": "2 cups (250g)",

      "steps": [
        "In a large bowl, whisk together flour, turmeric, and salt. In another bowl, beat eggs, then add coconut milk and water. Gradually whisk wet ingredients into dry to form a smooth, thin batter.",
        "Strain batter to remove lumps. Pour into a roti kirai cup or squeeze bottle (or use a fork for a DIY version).",
        "Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat and lightly grease. Drizzle batter in a lacy, circular pattern to form a net. Cook for 1-2 minutes until set but not browned. No need to flip.",
        "Remove and fold or roll into bundles. Repeat with remaining batter, greasing pan as needed.",
        "Serve warm with chicken or beef curry."

      "tips": [
        "Batter should be thin enough to flow easily; add more water if needed.",
        "A special roti kirai cup makes the lacy pattern easier, but a squeeze bottle or fork works in a pinch.",
        "Can be made ahead and reheated gently in a steamer."
